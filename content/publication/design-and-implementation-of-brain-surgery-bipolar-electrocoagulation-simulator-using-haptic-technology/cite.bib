  abstract = {Surgical simulators have been widely used in training and evaluation of physicians and surgeons. Virtual reality augmented with haptic technology has made it feasible to develop more realistic surgical simulators. In this context, we set out to design and develop a brain surgery bipolar electrocautery simulator using haptic technology. A 3D model of brain tissue was generated based on a brain craniotomy image. Bipolar forceps were also modeled to visually assimilate real forceps. An experiment was developed to assess the learning process of the participants. In this experiment, the volunteers were asked to cauterize a large blood vessel in the brain while minimizing the damage done to the brain tissue. The experiment was performed on 20 volunteers, and statistical analysis was conducted on the learning process and error reduction during the surgery. Next, the volunteers were divided into gamer and non-gamer groups. The analysis of the volunteersâ€™ operation demonstrated that, on average, there was a 5 percent reduction in the percentage of applied force error. It was also shown that the results achieved by the gamer and non-gamer group have significant difference with a p value of 0.0001. So, playing computer games would increase hand control, focus, and reflex and positively affect surgery skills.},
