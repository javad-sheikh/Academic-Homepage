abstract: In recent years, one of the most widely used tools in the training and
  evaluation of physicians and surgeons is surgical simulators. Introducing
  virtual reality and adding haptic technology to the field has made it feasible
  to develop ever-better surgical simulators. In this regard, we set out to
  design a brain surgery bipolar electrocoagulation simulator using haptic
  technology. A real image of brain tissue was taken, based on which a 3D model
  of this tissue was simulated. Thereafter, bipolar forceps and operation room
  visuals were added to the simulator. The visual and haptic features of the
  tissue and bipolar coagulation tool were considered. Finally, an experiment
  was developed to mutinously assess the simulator. The experiment was performed
  on 20 volunteers, and statistical analysis was conducted on the learning
  process and error reduction during the surgery. The volunteers were divided
  into gamer and non-gamer groups. The analysis of the volunteersâ€™ operation
  demonstrated the positive effect of the surgery simulator on enhancing user
  skills for both groups.
