abstract = {Accurate and efficient automated rice grain classification systems are vital for rice producers, distributors, and traders, offering improved quality control, cost optimization, and supply chain management. They also hold the potential to aid in the development of rice varieties that are more resistant to disease, pests, and environmental stress. While most existing studies in the rice classification domain rely on traditional machine-learning techniques that necessitate feature extraction engineering processes, our research explores the effectiveness of novel deep-learning models for this task. We evaluated the performance of various contemporary deep-learning models, including Residual Network (ResNet), Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network, EfficientNet, and MobileNet. These models were tested on a dataset comprising 75,000 images, classified into five different rice categories. We assessed each model using established evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and per-class accuracy. Our findings showed that the EfficientNet-based model delivered the highest accuracy (99.67%), while the MobileNet-based model excelled in the speed of classification (2556Â s). We concluded that, compared to traditional machine learning methods, the models employed in our study are highly scalable and capable of managing large volumes of complex data with millions of features and samples.}
