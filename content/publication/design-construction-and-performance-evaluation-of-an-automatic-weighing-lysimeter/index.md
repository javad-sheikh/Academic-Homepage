abstract: Evapotranspiration is an important component of the hydrologic cycle
  plays a large role in watershedâ€™s water balance study. Accurate estimation of
  evapotranspiration rate is essential for efficient management of irrigation,
  determination of plant's water demand as well as the design of irrigation
  systems. The aim of the current study is to design and construct a weighing
  lysimeter to address the need for accurate monitoring of evapotranspiration.
  The designed lysimeter in this research contains two concentric cylinders. The
  internal cylinder is the main container of the lysimeter and the outer
  cylinder has the role of protection and isolation of the main container from
  surrounding soil media. The main container is open-ended from the top but
  sealed in sidewalls and bottom end, except for orifices at the bottom end to
  drain the saturation excess water from the main container. The main container
  was made from 3 mm and 6 mm thick steel sheets for sidewall and bottom,
  respectively. The inner diameter and depth of the main container were 45 cm
  and 60 cm, respectively. After filling with soil, the containers were loaded
  on relatively precise and cheap loadcells fixed to a rigid metal framework. An
  electronic board, which can support four loadcells, was developed for
  calibration of loadcells and setting up the monitoring and recording the
  output signals of loadcells as a text file saved on an external memory card.
  The board can display the instantaneous weight of containers and save them at
  user-defined intervals. The results of the performance evaluation indicated
  that the developed lysimeter can measure and record temporal changes of soil
  moisture with acceptable accuracy.
