abstract: "Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and
  high-speed hardware, computers still do not have the same human capabilities
  for many cognitive activities. In the human brain, a large part of these
  activities is performed by the brain neocortex, one of which is detecting
  anomalies. In this study, we intend to use hierarchical temporal memory to
  recognize abnormal states in time series. Hierarchical temporal memory is a
  deep learning method that seeks to mimic the structural and algorithmic
  features of the brain neocortex. First, we implement this deep learning
  method, and then we present a solution to improve anomaly detection results.
  In our solution, in addition to the abnormality score that the network
  generates, we use the distance between the forecasted values and the actual
  values. We also change the classifier of this deep learning method to a
  support vector machine. The model presented achieved an F1 score of 0.350,
  which, compared to other deep learning methods, was one of the highest scores
  and the processing speed of this method was ten times faster than other
  methods. "
