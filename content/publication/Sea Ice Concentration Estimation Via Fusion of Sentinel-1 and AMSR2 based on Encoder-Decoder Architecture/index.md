abstract: 'Sea ice concentration estimation is crucial for secure ship navigation and ice hazard forecasting. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for sea ice concentration estimation over the Baltic Sea using two imaging modalities: Sentinel-1 and advanced microwave scanning radiometer2 (AMSR2). The main idea for fusing  these two sensors is Sentinel-1 images have high spatial resolution and AMSR2 provides images independent of wind conditions. Our two-stream architecture is to preserve all possible information of the different resolution inputs, instead of interpolating the inputs to the same resolution while losing potentially useful information. We also investigate the impact of two loss functions and skip connection on the performance of the proposed CNN model. The experimental results show that CNN with focal loss function and skip connection can achieve R2 score of 90.6%.'
summary: "This paper presents a new method using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate sea ice concentration in the Baltic Sea by combining Sentinel-1 and AMSR2 data. The CNN architecture retains different resolution inputs without losing valuable information. By using a focal loss function and skip connection, the proposed model achieves a high R2 score of 90.6%."
