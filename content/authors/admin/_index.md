As a D.Sc. candidate and researcher at the University of Turku, I am passionate about computer vision and deep learning. With a solid academic background in both artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as biomedical engineering, I bring a unique perspective to developing cutting-edge AI technologies. My interest in AI began during my undergraduate studies and led me to pursue a Master's degree in the field. During this time, my focus shifted to computer vision. I'm working on innovative solutions to complex visual problems as part of the AI-ARC project. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of AI research and development and exploring new ways these technologies can positively impact our world.
